# Hey! Thanks for stopping by!

## About Me
It's me! Hi! I'm... Swift-Nite, an enthusiastic developer primarily in Python and C#. I am currently studying computer science at University. I guess I'm just a... Boy trying to find a place in this world?

I have created the Fortnite Shop Sections Bot and Fortnite Staging Servers Bot available on GitHub (these are no longer active), as well as many private tools such as my item shop bot, various Fortnite leaking tools as well as a number of private home automation programs.

Outside of Fortnite and programming, if you couldn't tell, I am a swiftie! I have been to the Eras Tour (which was an enchanting experience). My favourite album is currently evermore (however it is very close) and my favourite song is currently also evermore (yes the evermore song with Bon Iver). I also listen to Gracie Abrams (I also went to her Good Riddance tour), Olivia Rodrigo and Sabrina Carpenter. Anyway, take the moment and taste it! You've got no reason to be afraid!

## My repos
### [Shop Sections Bot](https://github.com/swiftnite/Fortnite-Shop-Sections-Bot)
A bot that automatically posts the upcoming Fortnite item shop sections to X (formerly Twitter) as soon as they are updated (usually around 2 hours before item shop reset)!


### [Staging Servers Bot](https://github.com/swiftnite/Fortnite-Staging-Servers-Bot)
A bot that automatically posts to X (formerly Twitter) as soon as a new version is added to the Fortnite staging servers!
