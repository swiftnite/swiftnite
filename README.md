## About Me
I am Swift-Nite, a Fortnite dataminer on Twitter and a developer (Python/C#).

I have created the Fortnite Shop Sections Bot and Fortnite Staging Servers Bot available on GitHub, as well as private tools such as my item shop bot.

## My repos
### [Shop Sections Bot](https://github.com/swiftnite/Fortnite-Shop-Sections-Bot)
A bot that automatically posts the upcoming Fortnite item shop sections to twitter as soon as they are updated (usually around 2 hours before item shop reset)!


### [Staging Servers Bot](https://github.com/swiftnite/Fortnite-Staging-Servers-Bot)
A bot that automatically posts to twitter as soon as a new version is added to the Fortnite staging servers!
